# ST-Dual-token
Secret Trees is an industrial hemp producer that reduces supply chains and transportation costs for the hemp community. We create refined products by producing demand set through STU token, in our Latvian based factory, that can be distributed as per the token holders wishes. Business activities encourage the use of renewable and environmentally friendly materials to both individuals and existing hemp producers, who will now be able to create hemp based products through the Secret Trees factory.

Our ERC-721 tokens come in two distinct forms.

The Secret Trees Equity token (STE), encompasses a stake in the company with annual dividends, and;
The Secret Trees Hemp token (STU), shall be backed to the value of hemp in the Secret Trees forecasted production line, allowing access to our high-quality, EU produced hemp. Voting rights as to diversification routes of refined products are also afforded.
